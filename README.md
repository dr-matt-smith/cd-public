# Matt Smith : Curriculum Vitae / Résumé

##  Summary of Research Interests

My research is focused on the investigation and development of AI and interactive multimedia-based approaches for supporting learning in a domain-independent way. My work has included collaborations with researchers at the Language Centre of Brighton University, England, the Institute for Learning and Teaching Research at London Metropolitan University, England, the Department of Computing at Aberdeen University’s King’s College, Scotland, the Department of Computing at Edinburgh University, Scotland, the School of Computing and Mathematics at the Open University, England, and TecGraf at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Currently I’m pursuing the exploitation of interactive game technologies to support learning in the field of serious games, and general exploration of novel interactions offered by Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies.
